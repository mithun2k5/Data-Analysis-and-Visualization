Project Outline:
##########################################################
In this project we have analyzed the data of 1048575 records from
"Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection" 
(http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database#topic=consumer_navigation)
to analyze consumer complain as per state,per company for the year of 2014.
Moreover, after analyzing the filtered and processed data, a monthly
consumer complain analysis is given for the company which receives
highest complaint. 

Working Procedure:
################################################
1. Raw Data Download: 
Raw data is downloaded from the "Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection".
It is CSV(Comma Separated Vale) file.

2. Data Pre-processing:
Before loading data into HDFS(Hadoop Distributed Filesystem),data
need to pre-processed so that data can be transformed easily by Hive.
For example, all "NULL" values is replaced by "N/A",all unnecessary
columns is discarded etc. Special care taken for company name because
our file is CSV,which means all fields are separated by comma(), but 
in some company names comma(,) is included as part of company name.
In theses case, for the column-name company, all comma is replaced
by space(" ").The filtered data is uploaded in github account.

3.Data Upload(From local to HDFS):
The filtered data is then uploaded to HDFS.

4.Hive Table Creation for Data Analysis:
An external table is created in Hive for data analyis and another new table
is created in Hive after analyzing data. The newly created file will
be used for data visualization by "Tableau Public" tool.

5.Data Visualization by Tableau Public:
The processed data is downloaded from HDFS location to local directory
